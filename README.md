# Machine Learning Learning Path

This repository is designed to help you learn Machine Learning step by step.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experiments and learning
- `src/`: Source code for ML models and utilities
- `data/`: Directory for datasets
- `models/`: Saved model files
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
